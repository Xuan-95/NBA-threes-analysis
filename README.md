# NBA-threes-analysis

Statistical analysis of the actual NBA, more oriented toward three point shots,
using machine learning models and non-linear analysis techniques like Partial
Derivation Plots in order to estimate the efficiency of the new play style.

The Dataset is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games

In our model we use 2 dataset:

* games.csv : all games from 2004 season to last update with the date, teams and some details like number of points, etc.
* games_details.csv : details of games dataset, all statistics of players for a given game
